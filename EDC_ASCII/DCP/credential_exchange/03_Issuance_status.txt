Descripción Técnica:

Because issuance is asynchronous (potentially requiring manual approval or complex checks), the Holder must poll for the status of their request using the ID received in step 2.

(1) Check Status: The Holder calls the Credential Request Status API using the process ID returned during the issuance request.

(2) Current State: The Issuer queries the IssuanceProcessStore to find the current state of the process (e.g., RECEIVED, IN_PROGRESS, ISSUED, FAILED). This allows the Holder to know when the credential is ready to be delivered or if the request was denied.
